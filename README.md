# LeBron_James_Career
A visual analysis of LeBron James' NBA career in Python.

As of Feb 8th, LeBron James is officially the all time scoring leader in the NBA. An incredible feat of scoring, longevity, and professionalism by LeBron. 

This project analyzes his career in points, assists, 3-pointers, etc with various visuals including plotly, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Some of the visuals will not show up on github but they will if you run the notebook in Juypter notebooks or Google Colab.
